# Simple_Genetic_Algorithm

I have built 2 projects.
The Genetic_OldCode was my effort to create a simple genetic code and I did it to work, with no intention to be a nice code to read (it is ugly as hell!).
The Genetic_CleanCode is the same functionality of Genetic_OldCode, but I applied the "Clean Code" principles. I have changed variables names, class, methods and I have created others class (main classes and helpers and extension). 

Is Genetic_CleanCode perfect? No.
Is Genetic_CleanCode better than Genetic_OldCode? Yes. Even creating more classes and methods and variables, the code is readable.
Can Genetic_CleanCode get better? Yes. In the future I will be reviewing that code.

What is it all about? It is all about practice, even if I konw and read a lot about "Clean Code" and others code principles, put it in practice is the only way to achiev perfection.

So... practice == perfection.
